# NoorSphere – Social Media Project

NoorSphere is a **hands-on social media project** I built to practice and apply everything I’ve learned in full-stack development.

## 🔍 Overview

This simple yet complete social media platform allows users to:
- ✏️ Create and manage posts  
- 👤 Manage their profiles  
- ➕ Follow other users  
- 🔍 Explore new developers and content  
- 📷 Upload media (images)  
- 💬 Like and comment on posts 

The goal was to combine front-end and back-end skills into a real-world-style application.
